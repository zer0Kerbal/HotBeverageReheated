This discussion concerns .1 meter high stack fuel cells. Each module contains the fuel cell, fuel tank (in units) and a battery module. These will be released shortly in another (related) parts only mod which is being prepped for release.

I want your input as to the game balance of each of the sizes, and where on the tech tree they should appear

I have included fuselage versions (mk0-mk5) just in case I can find a model/texture that will allow these to be included.
