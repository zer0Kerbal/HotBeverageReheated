#### Known issues:
 An ongoing thread for random parts nli2work made for the fun of it. All will work with vanilla KSP. With the magic of ModuleManager some parts will behave differently depending on the mods you are running, or you may get extra parts that work only if certain mods are installed. There're no interdependencies... so you can remove the parts you don't want by deleting the part's folder.

nli2work will simply add parts as his fancy strikes him.

Install instructions: download the part you want; place in GameData/DrKermnassusPartsEmporium
